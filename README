Is a object-oriented and declarative programming language with a dynamic, pluggable virtual machine architecture. For information on the language constructs and defnition view the grammar in docs/BNF.

Technical Specifics:
Should be able to seamlessly integrate with Redis, MySQL, Postgres and eventually MSSql, Riak and other proven datastores.
The declarative syntax will be backed with a Propagation engine.  This engine will determine dependencies and automatically calculate values for attributes of objects, or globals. For specification on the architecture see docs/Interpreter
