BOML:
BOML Is a business oriented modeling language.  The goal is to create a simple language that will allow people with little programming experience to easily model their business processes.  More information to come on language syntax and capabilities including the propagator.

Technical Specifics:
BOML Should be able to seamlessly integrate with Redis, MySQL, Postgres and eventually MSSql, Riak and other proven datastores.
BOML Will provide both functions, oo, and declarative syntaxes.  
The declarative syntax will be backed with a Propagation engine.  This engine wil determin depencenies and automatically calculate values for attributes of objects, or globals.  -- more clear definition to come.
