Claru
Claru is a dynamic programming language and virtual machine set. More information to come on language syntax and capabilities including the propagator.

Technical Specifics:
Should be able to seamlessly integrate with Redis, MySQL, Postgres and eventually MSSql, Riak and other proven datastores.
Will provide both functions, oo, and declarative syntaxes.  
The declarative syntax will be backed with a Propagation engine.  This engine wil determin depencenies and automatically calculate values for attributes of objects, or globals.  -- more clear definition to come.
